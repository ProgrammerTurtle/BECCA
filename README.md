# BECCA
BECCA stands for Big Engine Certification Completion Attempt.
This is a fully custom designed L1 Certification rocket standing at 5 feet tall with a main body diameter of 3 inches and is projected to reach a max height of one mile AGL (above ground level).
It will be flying on either an i500 or i280 high power DMS (single use) solid rocket motor from Aerotech, pending available stock.

BECCA utilizes dual seperation dual deploy parachutes controlled via altimeters located in the avionics bay. A smaller 15 inch parachute, called the Drogue parachute, deploys at apogee (the highest point of the flight) via electronically detonated black powder charges. This slows down descent to a safer velocity but still allows the rocket to descend wihtout drifting very far. Once it reaches 500 feet AGL the larger 58 inch parachute, stored in the aft airframe, is deployed via a second set of black powder charges. This slows the rocket down to a safe landing velocity. 
The avionics bay also features a custom reovery GPS device which uses a particle boron paired with an adafruit ultimate gps featherwing to provide GPS coordinates of the landed rocket for an easy recovery.
