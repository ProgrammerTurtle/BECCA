# BECCA
BECCA stands for **Big Engine Certification Completion Attempt**.
This is a fully custom designed L1 Certification rocket that:
- Stands at 5 Feet Tall
- Has a main body diameter of 3 inches
- Will reach an apogee of 1 mile
- Will reach a max speed of mach 0.8
- Will fly on an Aerotech I500 DMS Engine

BECCA utilizes a dual-separation dual-deploy parachute system controlled via altimeters located in the avionics bay. A smaller 15 inch parachute, called the Drogue parachute, deploys at apogee (the highest point of the flight) via electronically detonated black powder charges. This slows down descent to a safer velocity but stillfast enough to (hopefully) not drift very far. Once it reaches an altitude of 500 feet AGL, the larger 58 inch parachute, stored in the aft airframe, is deployed via a second set of black powder charges. This slows the rocket down to a safe landing velocity. 
The avionics bay also features a custom recovery GPS device which uses a Particle Boron paired with an Adafruit Ultimate GPS Featherwing to provide GPS coordinates of the landed rocket for an easy recovery.
