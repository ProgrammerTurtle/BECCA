BECCA stands for **Big Engine Certification Completion Attempt**.

This is a fully custom L1 Certification rocket that:

- Stands at 5 Feet Tall

- Has a main body diameter of 3 inches

- Will reach a max altitude of 1 mile

- Will reach a max speed of Mach 0.8

- Will fly on an Aerotech I500 Single-Use Solid Rocket Engine

BECCA utilizes a dual-separation dual-deploy parachute system controlled via altimeters located in the avionics bay. A smaller 15-inch parachute, called the Drogue parachute, deploys at apogee (the highest point of the flight) via electronically detonated black powder charges. This slows down descent to a safer velocity, but still fast enough to (hopefully) not drift very far. Once it reaches an altitude of 500 feet AGL, the larger 58-inch parachute, stored in the aft airframe, is deployed via a second set of black powder charges. This slows the rocket down to a safe landing velocity. 
The avionics bay also features a custom recovery GPS device, which uses a Particle Boron paired with an Adafruit Ultimate GPS Featherwing to provide GPS coordinates of the landed rocket for easy recovery.
